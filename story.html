<h1>我的天，这是我近来听过的最强的故事</h1>
<hr>

有一个老人自己坐在一条漆黑的道路上。嗯？他不知道该走哪个方向，而且他忘记了他要去哪里，也忘记他自己是谁。他坐了一阵子，休息一下，然后突然抬头，看到他面前有一个老女人，她笑了，说：“现在，你的第三个愿望是什么？”<br/>
“第三个愿望？”那个男人吓了一跳。“如果我没有许第一个和第二个愿望，怎么会有第三个愿望？”<br/>
“你已经有两个愿望了。”那个夜巫。“但是你的第二个愿望是要我把所有的东西恢复成你许第一个愿望之前的样子。所以你才会什么都不记得：因为所有的事情都和你许第一个愿望之前一模一样。”她对那个可怜的家伙笑笑。“所以你只剩下一个愿望。”<br/>
“好吧”那个男人说。“我不相信这个，但是许愿不会有什么伤害。我想要知道我是谁。”<br/>
“真好笑。”那个女人成全了他的愿望，然后永远地消失了。“那是你的第一个愿望。”<br/>

"An elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path, right? He wasn't certain of which direction to go, and he'd forgotten both where he was traveling to and who he was. He'd sat down for a moment to rest his weary legs, and suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him. She grinned toothlessly and with a cackle, spoke: 'Now your *third* wish. What will it be?'"<br/>
<br/>
"'Third wish?' The man was baffled. 'How can it be a third wish if I haven't had a first and second wish?'"
<br/>

"'You've had two wishes already,' the hag said, 'but your second wish was for me to return everything to the way it was before you had made your first wish. That's why you remember nothing; because everything is the way it was before you made any wishes.' She cackled at the poor berk. 'So it is that you have one wish left.'"<br/>
<br/>
"'All right,' said the man, "I don't believe this, but there's no harm in wishing. I wish to know who I am.'"<br/>
"'Funny,' said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever. 'That was your first wish.'"<br/>

出自异域镇魂曲，莫提讲的故事。<br/>

<br/>
强就强在看完了还会令人再想一想。<br/>
